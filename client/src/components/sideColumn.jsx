        I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. I enjoy the process of creating websites from scratch. My coding journey started in the year of 2019. I currently go to Cal Poly Pomona where I took a Web Development course and decided I want to get into that feild. I am up for any challenge and love to learn new skills. For my free time I like to watch movies or play video games. One of my favorite movie series to watch every year is Harry Potter.
